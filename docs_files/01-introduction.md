# Introduction: Why Code Optimization Matters

In modern computing, the efficiency of algorithms directly affects hardware performance, energy usage, and system scalability. Poorly optimized code can:

- Overload the CPU
- Consume unnecessary memory
- Drain battery life (in mobile devices)
- Increase server costs (in cloud environments)

This research demonstrates how small improvements in common algorithms can make a big difference, especially in large-scale systems or resource-constrained environments.

We present six optimization examples using C++, focusing on:
- Reducing **time complexity**
- Lowering **memory usage**
- Improving **energy efficiency**

Letâ€™s dive into real-world examples of how better algorithms lead to smarter, greener computing.
