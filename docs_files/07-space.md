# Example 6: Space Optimization

## Unoptimized Selection Sort

Creates a new array for sorted elements â€” consumes extra memory.

## In-Place Selection Sort

Sorts the array within the same memory space, saving RAM.

**Benefits:**
- Saves memory
- Crucial for embedded or memory-limited systems

### Optimization Impact
In-place operations reduce memory footprint, making code more efficient and scalable.
