# Example 1: Searching Optimization

## Linear Search – O(n)

Linear search scans each element one by one until the target is found. It’s simple, but slow for large datasets.

**Drawbacks:**
- Time-consuming for big arrays
- Higher CPU usage

## Binary Search – O(log n)

Binary search divides the array in half each step. Much faster but requires the array to be **sorted** first.

**Benefits:**
- Significantly faster
- Lower processing power
- Ideal for large-scale applications

### Optimization Impact
Replacing linear search with binary search improves energy efficiency and speeds up response time in large datasets.
