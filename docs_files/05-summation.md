# Example 4: Summation Optimization

## Iterative Approach – O(n)

Adds numbers from 1 to n one by one in a loop.

## Mathematical Formula – O(1)

Uses the formula: `S = n(n + 1) / 2`  
One calculation — no loop needed.

**Benefits:**
- Constant time calculation
- Ideal for large values of n
- Practically instant result

### Optimization Impact
Goes from linear time to constant time — huge gain in performance and energy savings.
