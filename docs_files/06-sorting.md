# Example 5: Sorting Optimization

## Bubble Sort – O(n²)

Repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements. Very slow for big arrays.

## Merge Sort – O(n log n)

Uses divide-and-conquer to sort smaller subarrays, then merges them efficiently.

**Benefits:**
- Much faster than bubble sort
- Better for large data processing
- Lower CPU cycles

### Optimization Impact
Replacing Bubble Sort with Merge Sort drastically reduces time complexity and CPU load.
